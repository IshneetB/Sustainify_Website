<div class="info">
  <p>Sustainability is a major issue facing our world. With a limited amount of resources and a growing amount of waste and single use items, we must act quickly to preserve our world for the wellbeing of our future generations.</p>
</div>  
  
<div class="info">
  <p>The only way we can do so is by implementing sustainable solutions to reverse the damage that has already been done. However, when thinking of sustainability and sustainable solutions, many think these are complicated and tedious, leading them to not implement these solutions. Seeing this issue, we decided to create Sustainify, a place where people can learn about sustainability, and easy "life hacks" to implement sustainable practices in their daily lives. These practices aren't hard, and we aim to meet people where they are, offering practices they can realistically implement, because we firmly believe that doing anything is far better than doing nothing. Through these simple life hacks, we hope to promote a more sustainable way of living, and ultimately, save our world for our future generations.</p>
